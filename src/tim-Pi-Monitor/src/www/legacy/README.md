Legacy Client
===================


This is the old UI that is used to interface with the server. 

> **Note:**
While I will continue to support the old client by keeping the server backwards-compatible (or in some cases bringing the old client up to speed), new features WILL NOT be added to this client. They will only be found in the current version.
