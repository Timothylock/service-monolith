	  	  <h4>October 30, 2016</h4>
	  	  <p>Thank you for your interest in the extra sessions. We have successfully added extra sessions as stated in the previous update. Due to the extra costs of renting the facility, staffing, etc., the monthly cost will change effective November 3rd. Please email carmen@logicfusion.ca for more details.</p>

	  	  <br>
	  	  <h4>October 27, 2016</h4>
	  	  <p>Please make sure that you are able to complete the <a href="files">last challenge</a>. Try to do it in a way that it makes use of the light sensor. When you are done, check out the challenges/missions through the FLL site (linked above) to start thinking about how you would complete each challenge. In fact, try to create some programs for it!</p>
	  	  <p>Our competition date has been finalized and we have been assigned to the Toronto (Mary Ward) Qualifying Tournament taking place on <b>December 3rd, at Mary Ward CSS, 3200 Kennedy Rd, Scarborough, ON M1V 3S8.</b></p>

	  	  <br>
	  	  <h4>October 20, 2016</h4>
	  	  <p>Thank you for coming to the first session! I have uploaded today's code in case you are stuck on the challenges. For those who have an EV3 at home, I have uploaded instructions for the EV3 base car as well as the line follower attachment. Please make sure you have Microsoft Word to open those instructions. Finally, if you feel like you are struggling, I have uploaded our EV3 Level 2 powerpoint. Try to run through some examples if you are stuck. We will go over challenge 4 next week. See you next week!</p>
