				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At last, I finally came home from university and I got a chance to look closely at the TVpad. Ever since my parents got it, I was curious on what it ran on (let&#8217;s face it, a lot of knockoff Chinese media players run android). The website said it was android 4.4 and at that point, I made it my mission to be able to install my own apk files on it.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t an easy task. The developers made quite the effort to hide the default system UI from the user. At first, I plugged in a mouse and low and behold. Dragging the cursor down from the top of the screen produced the android notification center. From there, I was able to get into the settings screen and see all the goodies. Suprisingly, it seems as if the developers shrunk the top bar into a few pixels height. Clever trick! Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t install apks from that screen.</p>
<p>So at this point, I was a bit disappointed. A good lead but it got me nowhere. Then I opened up TVpad&#8217;s internet browser and downloaded ES File Manager apk. Just like that, it installed. Now I was able to look into the system and &#8220;unlock&#8221; the default apps (dialer, browser, etc). On addition to that, I was able to extract all of their own apps (their TV apps). Going to see if it can run on my other android stick!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being at student at UofT (which as we know the TAs are on strike), I was heartbroken to see my instructor (on strike) sitting outside our class while a replacement instructor came in to teach. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, having a replacement is not what I am upset about (that&#8217;s the least the university can do for us students).</p>
<p>What upset me is that she was sitting outside not holding a picket sign or anything. She wasn&#8217;t even even holding pamphlets or anything to promote CUPE 3902 or anything. She was just sitting there out of her own time to answer any questions that we had about the strike. Whether this was a move by the union to make us students side with them or not, the fact that she was sitting out there in the cold answering our questions is a hell of a lot more than the university administration has been doing (They still keep us in the dark).</p>
<p>In fact, I saw my TA outside of class and I told her how I was worried about the course and grades and stepping on the boundary, my TA gave me tips to studying, what I should focus on and all that despite them not supposed to be talking about course work during their strike. Its nice to see that the TAs aren&#8217;t only pretending to care about us (which in my opinion is all the university has been doing). Or maybe they are&#8230; but they are still hiding it a lot better than the university (lets face it. All the &#8220;good&#8221; benefits that the university gives us students is because UTSU fought for them).</p>
<p>I may agree that some of the union&#8217;s requests are unreasonable and that the university has to see the bigger picture, manage funding, etc and that they have their reasons; but clearly the university has to tackle this issue rather than waiting it out. Using students as a bargaining chip is just really disappointing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tim again! Unfortunately, my Pebble&#8217;s screen recently started glitching on me. For those of you who don&#8217;t know what the Pebble is, it is a smartwatch with an e-ink paper display. For the duration that I had (well actually still have) it, I thoroughly enjoyed it as it complemented my phone&#8217;s features such as notifying me of notifications, allowing me to reply, control music, etc.</p>
<p>Recently, my pebble started to show this:</p>
<p><a href="http://timothylock.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/unnamed.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-585 aligncenter" src="http://timothylock.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/unnamed-225x300.jpg" alt="unnamed" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I shot Pebble support a quick email and fortunately for me, they will be sending me a replacement watch. I thought it was going to be a pain because I got this refurbished from their booth at Hack The North. Never have I thought I could get through the RMA process in a matter of 1 reply. Good for them!</p>
<p>Will update this when I receive my replacement!</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>update:</p>
<p>My replacement came in! I originally purchased my Pebble refurbished from them. They ended up giving me a new unit! Good for them <img src="http://timothylock.ca/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately, it also glithes but I will have to use it a bit longer just in case.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a long time of debating with myself, I have finally started a blog on my website! In fact, I started this blog the day after I purchased timothylock.ca to celebrate new beginnings. I was going to start the blog last week but unfortunately I was at McHacks (hackathon in Montreal) and I did not have time to make it.</p>
<p>On that note, I just recently got back from McHacks and I have to say that as my 5th hackathon, it was still an enjoyable one. One thing that was different about McHacks compared to other hackathons such as Hack The North, MHacks, etc is that this one was short. Instead of having 36 hours, we only had 24 hours to make our app. Besides that, the food was excellent, lines (despite being long) moved quickly so you could be at the back of the line and then be at the front for food in less than 5 minutes. The bus ride was long (pickup at UofT at 1am) with its 6 hour bus ride but it was still enjoyable (got a lot of sleep).</p>
<p>In the end, my group and I made a nice app that uses machine learning to predict what products may interest you and links to purchase them off of eBay</p>
<p><a href="http://timothylock.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/points.png"><img class="  wp-image-576 aligncenter" src="http://timothylock.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/points-300x154.png" alt="points" width="602" height="309" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until next time,</p>
